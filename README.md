Sudoku on Sinatra
========

### Basic Sudoku Puzzle Solver (Web Version)

This project took the code I had made in my [Sudoku Puzzle Solver](https://github.com/HannahKnights/sudoku) and incorporated it into a Sinatra application.

This was the first project I set-up to run on local web at Makers Accademy and my first introduction to Sinatra. 

The task is not complete, however the learning exercise and introduction to setting-up Sinatra, installing Gem's and developing it locally was important.

Created while studying at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com)
